# Blood biomarker analyses in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)

Here, we aimed to find a small set of plasma proteins to differentiate patients with ccRCC from healthy controls. 
We further found associations between plasma protein levels and protein levels in solid tumors from the same patients, showing relationships in particular with TGF-Î² and VHL-HIF signaling pathways.
