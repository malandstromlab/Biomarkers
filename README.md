# Blood biomarker analyses in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)

Here, we aimed to find a small set of plasma proteins to differentiate patients with ccRCC from healthy controls. 
We further found associations between plasma protein levels and protein levels in solid tumors from the same patients, showing relationships in particular with TGF-Î² and VHL-HIF signaling pathways.

## The dependencies
- R and RStudio (see the script for exact packages needed)
- Python (if you want to plot some more figures)

## The data
Retrieve data from the paper when published. It containes blood plasma protein levels, detected via an Olink panel. 

## The scripts
- R-script: Run the full analysis and plot figures.
- Python-script: Generate the data files to create box-plots of the biomarker levels in patients vs healthy controls.
